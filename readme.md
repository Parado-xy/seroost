# Seroost

A lightning-fast document search engine built in Rust that indexes and searches through your documents using TF-IDF scoring.
**Note that credit goes to tsoding daily on YT for starting the project about 2 years ago. He created an XML search engine with a web interface and thought of extending it. I don't think he finished the project though, so i extended it from just xml and made it a CLI tool. Here's his yt channel: https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily**



## Latest Updates (v2.0)

- ⚡ **Multi-threaded indexing** utilizing all available CPU cores
- 📊 **Improved memory management** with file size limits
- 🎨 **Enhanced CLI output** with color-coded status messages
- 🔄 **Streaming file processing** for better performance
- 🔍 **Extended file format support** (PDF, TXT, XML, HTML)

## Features

- 🚀 **Parallel processing** for faster document indexing
- 🔍 **TF-IDF based search** with relevance scoring
- 📁 **Recursive directory traversal**
- ⚙️ **System-aware configuration storage**
- 🛠️ **User-friendly CLI** with detailed feedback

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (1.70 or later)
- Linux-based system (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parado-xy/seroost.git
cd seroost
cargo build --release

# Optional: Create a symlink to use from anywhere
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/target/release/seroost" /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

### Indexing documents

```bash
# Index with default settings
seroost --index-path /path/to/documents index

# Index with custom file size limit (in MB)
seroost --index-path /path/to/documents --max-file-size 50 index
```

### Searching documents

```bash
# Simple search
seroost search "your query"

## Implementation Details

- **Multi-threaded Architecture:**
  - Separate threads for directory traversal
  - Worker thread pool for file processing
  - Dedicated thread for term frequency calculations

- **Memory Management:**
  - Configurable file size limits
  - Efficient string handling
  - Streaming file processing

- **Search Algorithm:**
  - TF-IDF scoring for relevance
  - Document frequency optimization
  - Top-K results ranking
